# MatJava
Java library for advanced math operations

#### It's like Matlab but slower, not as syntactically elegant, incomplete, and much less powerful!

## Current Features

- complex numbers
- fractions
- matrices and many matrix operations
- reading image file and getting arrays of pixel colouring/writing array of pixels to image
- Fourier transforms
- ¯\\(. _ .)/¯


## Examples

- [test cases](https://github.com/Ben-Wu/MatJava/tree/master/matjava2/src/test/java/ca/benwu)


- [image compression using discrete cosine transform](https://github.com/Ben-Wu/MatJava/blob/master/matjava2/src/main/java/ca/benwu/examples/ImageCompressionExample.java)
